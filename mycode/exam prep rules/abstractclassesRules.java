//keyword abstract must be used
//it has no implementation in the class so you need to create an implementing class
//protected and public can be inherited
// abstract class not required to include any abstract method (but it can, just not required)
//abstract class method in an abstract class cannot have a body, but the other methods can have a body
//default method in abstract classes: you cant provide a default implementation,youcant define a method with abody, you cant mark it as abstract in an abstract class
//as long you do not mark it as final the subclass has the option to override it 
//an abstract class cannot be marked as final 
//an abstract class is one that must be extended by another class to be instantieted whereas a final class cant be extended by another class
//it cant be private because it wont be visible to the subclass 

// creating conctrete class,learned from interfaces
//abstract classed cannot be instantiated
//an abstract class becomes usefull whenits extended by a concrete subclass
//a concrete class is the first nonabstract sublclass that extends an abstract class and it is required to implement all inherited abstract methods
//abstract classes can extend other abstract classes are not required to provide implementations for any of the abstract methods
//concrete class that extends an abstract class must implement all inhereted abstract methods.
